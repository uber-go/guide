# Embedding in Structs

Embedded types should be at the top of the field list of a
struct, and there must be an empty line separating embedded fields from regular
fields.

Embedding should provide tangible benefit, like adding or augmenting
functionality in a semantically-appropriate way. It should do this with zero
adverse user-facing effects (see also: [Avoid Embedding Types in Public Structs]).

Exception: Mutexes should not be embedded, even on unexported types. See also: [Zero-value Mutexes are Valid].

Embedding **should not**:

- Be purely cosmetic or convenience-oriented.
- Make outer types more difficult to construct or use.
- Affect outer types' zero values. If the outer type has a useful zero value, it
  should still have a useful zero value after embedding the inner type.
- Expose unrelated functions or fields from the outer type as a side-effect of
  embedding the inner type.
- Expose unexported types.
- Affect outer types' copy semantics.
- Change the outer type's API or type semantics.
- Embed a non-canonical form of the inner type.
- Expose implementation details of the outer type.
- Allow users to observe or control type internals.
- Change the general behavior of inner functions through wrapping in a way that
  would reasonably surprise users.

Simply put, embed consciously and intentionally. A good litmus test is, "would
all of these exported inner methods/fields be added directly to the outer type";
if the answer is "some" or "no", don't embed the inner type - use a field
instead.
