# Linting

More importantly than any "blessed" set of linters, lint consistently across a
codebase.

We recommend using the following linters at a minimum, because we feel that they
help to catch the most common issues and also establish a high bar for code
quality without being unnecessarily prescriptive:

- [errcheck] to ensure that errors are handled
- [goimports] to format code and manage imports
- [golint] to point out common style mistakes
- [govet] to analyze code for common mistakes
- [staticcheck] to do various static analysis checks

  [errcheck]: https://github.com/kisielk/errcheck
  [goimports]: https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
  [golint]: https://github.com/golang/lint
  [govet]: https://golang.org/cmd/vet/
  [staticcheck]: https://staticcheck.io/

## Lint Runners

We recommend [golangci-lint] as the go-to lint runner for Go code, largely due
to its performance in larger codebases and ability to configure and use many
canonical linters at once. This repo has an example [.golangci.yml] config file
with recommended linters and settings.

golangci-lint has [various linters] available for use. The above linters are
recommended as a base set, and we encourage teams to add any additional linters
that make sense for their projects.
