# Package Names

When naming packages, choose a name that is:

- All lower-case. No capitals or underscores.
- Does not need to be renamed using named imports at most call sites.
- Short and succinct. Remember that the name is identified in full at every call
  site.
- Not plural. For example, `net/url`, not `net/urls`.
- Not "common", "util", "shared", or "lib". These are bad, uninformative names.
