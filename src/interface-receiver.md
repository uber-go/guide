# Receivers and Interfaces

Methods with value receivers can be called on pointers as well as values.
Methods with pointer receivers can only be called on pointers or [addressable values].

  [addressable values]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_values

For example,

```go
type S struct {
  data string
}

func (s S) Read() string {
  return s.data
}

func (s *S) Write(str string) {
  s.data = str
}

// We cannot get pointers to values stored in maps, because they are not
// addressable values.
sVals := map[int]S{1: {"A"}}

// We can call Read on values stored in the map because Read
// has a value receiver, which does not require the value to
// be addressable.
sVals[1].Read()

// We cannot call Write on values stored in the map because Write
// has a pointer receiver, and it's not possible to get a pointer
// to a value stored in a map.
//
//  sVals[1].Write("test")

sPtrs := map[int]*S{1: {"A"}}

// You can call both Read and Write if the map stores pointers,
// because pointers are intrinsically addressable.
sPtrs[1].Read()
sPtrs[1].Write("test")
```

Similarly, an interface can be satisfied by a pointer, even if the method has a
value receiver.

```go
type F interface {
  f()
}

type S1 struct{}

func (s S1) f() {}

type S2 struct{}

func (s *S2) f() {}

s1Val := S1{}
s1Ptr := &S1{}
s2Val := S2{}
s2Ptr := &S2{}

var i F
i = s1Val
i = s1Ptr
i = s2Ptr

// The following doesn't compile, since s2Val is a value, and there is no value receiver for f.
//   i = s2Val
```

Effective Go has a good write up on [Pointers vs. Values].
