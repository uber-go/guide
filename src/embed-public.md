# Avoid Embedding Types in Public Structs

These embedded types leak implementation details, inhibit type evolution, and
obscure documentation.

Assuming you have implemented a variety of list types using a shared
`AbstractList`, avoid embedding the `AbstractList` in your concrete list
implementations.
Instead, hand-write only the methods to your concrete list that will delegate
to the abstract list.

```go
type AbstractList struct {}

// Add adds an entity to the list.
func (l *AbstractList) Add(e Entity) {
  // ...
}

// Remove removes an entity from the list.
func (l *AbstractList) Remove(e Entity) {
  // ...
}
```

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
// ConcreteList is a list of entities.
type ConcreteList struct {
  *AbstractList
}
```

</td><td>

```go
// ConcreteList is a list of entities.
type ConcreteList struct {
  list *AbstractList
}

// Add adds an entity to the list.
func (l *ConcreteList) Add(e Entity) {
  l.list.Add(e)
}

// Remove removes an entity from the list.
func (l *ConcreteList) Remove(e Entity) {
  l.list.Remove(e)
}
```

Go allows [type embedding] as a compromise between inheritance and composition.
The outer type gets implicit copies of the embedded type's methods.
These methods, by default, delegate to the same method of the embedded
instance.

The struct also gains a field by the same name as the type.
So, if the embedded type is public, the field is public.
To maintain backward compatibility, every future version of the outer type must
keep the embedded type.

An embedded type is rarely necessary.
It is a convenience that helps you avoid writing tedious delegate methods.

Even embedding a compatible AbstractList *interface*, instead of the struct,
would offer the developer more flexibility to change in the future, but still
leak the detail that the concrete lists use an abstract implementation.

<thead><tr><th>Bad</th><th>Good</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>

```go
// AbstractList is a generalized implementation
// for various kinds of lists of entities.
type AbstractList interface {
  Add(Entity)
  Remove(Entity)
}

// ConcreteList is a list of entities.
type ConcreteList struct {
  AbstractList
}
```

</td><td>

```go
// ConcreteList is a list of entities.
type ConcreteList struct {
  list AbstractList
}

// Add adds an entity to the list.
func (l *ConcreteList) Add(e Entity) {
  l.list.Add(e)
}

// Remove removes an entity from the list.
func (l *ConcreteList) Remove(e Entity) {
  l.list.Remove(e)
}
```

Either with an embedded struct or an embedded interface, the embedded type
places limits on the evolution of the type.

- Adding methods to an embedded interface is a breaking change.
- Removing methods from an embedded struct is a breaking change.
- Removing the embedded type is a breaking change.
- Replacing the embedded type, even with an alternative that satisfies the same
  interface, is a breaking change.

Although writing these delegate methods is tedious, the additional effort hides
an implementation detail, leaves more opportunities for change, and also
eliminates indirection for discovering the full List interface in
documentation.
