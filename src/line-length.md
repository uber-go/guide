# Avoid overly long lines

Avoid lines of code that require readers to scroll horizontally
or turn their heads too much.

We recommend a soft line length limit of **99 characters**.
Authors should aim to wrap lines before hitting this limit,
but it is not a hard limit.
Code is allowed to exceed this limit.
